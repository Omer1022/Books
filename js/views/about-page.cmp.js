    <p>A book is a set of printed sheets of paper held together between two covers. 
      <br>
      The sheets of paper in a book are called pages. 
      <br>
      The pages have words written in them and illustrations drawn. 
      <br>
      The book is a more flexible format than the earlier idea of the scroll. 
      <br>
      The change from scrolls to books began in the Roman Empire and took many centuries to become complete.
      <br>
      A writer of a book is called an author. 
      <br>
      Someone who draws the pictures in a book is called an illustrator. 
      <br>
      Books can have more than one author or illustrator.
    <br>
  Enjoy Reading! </p>
